	  Rssfilter - standalone rss feed filter

	--------------------------------------

Rssfilter is a standalone program that filters rss feeds from items
matching pre-defined rules. Rssfilter acts as a filter layer between 
rss feeds and whatever program is reading the feed e.i. rssfilter 
adds filtering support for any application.


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------
Rssfilter is designed to simply read the feed from stdin and output 
the filtered version to stdout. Simple enough interface :)
Example of usage: 
	
	Output to file:
	$ wget -qO- http://example.com/feed | rssfilter -e pattern > filtered-feed.xml
	
	With application:
	$ wget -qO- http://example.com/feed | rssfilter -e pattern1 pattern2| feedhandler
